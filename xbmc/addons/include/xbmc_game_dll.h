 * intended for games where audio and video are completely asynchronous
 * and audio can be generated on the fly. This interface is not recommended
 * for use with emulators which have highly synchronous audio.
 *
 * The function only notifies about writability; the game client still
 * has to call the normal audio functions to write audio. The audio
 * functions must be called from within the notification function. The
 * amount of audio data to write is up to the implementation. Generally,
 * the audio function will be called continously in a loop.
 *
 * Due to thread safety guarantees and lack of sync between audio and
 * video, a frontend can selectively disallow this interface based on
 * internal configuration. A core using this interface must also implement
 * the "normal" audio interface.

 * support cases like fast-forward, slow-motion, frame stepping, etc. In this case the

 * affine transform to texture coordinates.
